        Yes, this website is also my project. Using React might be overkill for a portfolio site,
        but I enjoy writing code instead of writing pure HTML and CSS. One benefit of having a
        single-page app in React is that it can reduce the significant loading time between each
        page. I would like to provide the exceptional experience to viewers of my site as much as I
        can.
