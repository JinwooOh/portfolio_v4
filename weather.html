<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Weather web application. It uses Dark Sky API to gather weather information and OpenCage to gather geo-information.
  A user can type a zip code or a place name to see specific geolocational information with his or her choice of weather
  unit.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Initially, I used Wunderground API. It comes with both weather and geo-information so that I don't have to use other
  API for geo-information. Unfortunately, the API is no longer support free-tier option.</p>
<p>According to Dark Sky API, they have disabled CORS for security reason. To bypass CORS, I made the proxy API server.
  It takes a request from a client, and respond to a client with information that gathers from Dark Sky API. It also has
  the advantage of hiding a secret key since the client doesn't need to send an API call with a secret key.</p>
